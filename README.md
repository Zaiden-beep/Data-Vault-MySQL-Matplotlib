# Panda-list--Dataframes.py 
* on last week sprint i was deployed as a data vault manager. As part of my assignment, I was required to create a Pandas data list.
* Using Python pandas i created a list of Dataframes for products on this week sprint 

Sprint 2
Data Science.

## Project description:

I have been deployed as a Data Scientist. As part of my assignment, I am required to:

Add the following to my sprint 2 MySQL data using Python:

1. Add more products and their brands
2. Create more columns to your products. 
3. Create separate tables for each product

## Description of coding practices
  
  1. To start of, import the pandas as pd (Module). (depending on your IDE you may have to install panda first befor importing the module)
  
  2. Create dataframe and store values. 
  
  3. During the code i had the following error: "ValueError: arrays must all be same length"
       - What this means is that the values stored must be of the same length. 
         If you note in the above we have 7 Values, 6 of those values have two products/ arrays only one has three.
         Now what we have to do is to create empty strings to the rown that has two products. This should then make your arrays be of same length.
         
  4. Be sure you have Pands installed in your IDE or you will receive error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Pandas' " when importing pandas
      The following IDE comes with pands package when installed
