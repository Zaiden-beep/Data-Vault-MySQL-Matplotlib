2. Create table and add my.csv file to my workbench 
3. Import that data and use the matplotlib module to make a visual graph

## Description of coding practices
  
  1. To start of, import the pandas as pd (Module). (depending on your IDE you may have to install panda first befor importing the module)
  
  2. Create a MySQL server and workbench to store values in the table  
  
   
  3. Be sure you have Pands installed in your IDE or you will receive error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Pandas' " when importing pandas
